# rex2png - a utility for converting PNG files into REXPaint files

**Note: See [png2rex_rs](https://github.com/thebracket/png2rex_rs) for a version written in Rust, that I'm actually supporting.**

This is a simple utility I needed for [Black Future](https://github.com/thebracket/bgame) to convert PNG files into REXPaint format.
It handles transparency, and translucency with appropriate CP-467 tiles. It's pretty simple, but it does what I need. I hope
you find it useful!

## To build

This uses a standard CMake setup, and requires zlib and libpng. Typically:
 `mkdir build; cd build; cmake -g"Unix Makefiles" ../src; make` 
will get you going.

## Usage

`png2rex <inputfile> <outputfile`

For example:

`png2rex ../testimage/kitty.png kitty.xp`

You can then load the resulting image into your game, or with REXPaint.
